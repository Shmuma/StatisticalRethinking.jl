## Important note on StatisticalRethinking v3

This is a breaking change from v2 of StatisticalRethinking.jl. I expect the first stage of this work to be completed by late Nov 2020.

If you prefer to use v2, you can use `] add StatisticalRethinkingv2.2.9` where 2.2.9 is the latest released version for v2.

Given that Julia provides several very capable packages that support mcmc simulation, it only seemed appropriate to make StatisticalRethinking on Julia mcmc implementation independent.

The availablility of DynamicHMC, the huge progress made by the Turing.jl team over the last 2 years, the introduction of Julia `projects` in addition to Julia `packages`, the novel approach to notebooks in Pluto.jl and the work by [Karajan](https://github.com/karajan9/statisticalrethinking) were a few of the ideas that triggered exploring a new setup for StatisticalRethinking.jl and the 'course' projects [StatistcalRethinkingStan](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl) and [StatisticalrethinkingTuring](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl)

An early, experimental version of [StructuralCausalModels.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StructuralCausalModels.jl) is also included as a dependency in the StatisticalRethinking.jl v3 package. In the meantime I will definitely keep my eyes on [Omega.jl](https://github.com/zenna/Omega.jl) and [CausalInference.jl](https://github.com/mschauer/CausalInference.jl). StructuralCausalModels does provide ways to convert DAGs to Daggity and ggm formats.

Finally, for a good while I have been looking for a great statistics book using Julia as kind of an introductory text to StatisticalRethinking and I believe the first couple of chapters in an upcoming book [Statistics with Julia](https://statisticswithjulia.org/index.html) by Yoni Nazarathy and Hayden Klok are exactly that.

As [StatisticalRethinking](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia) v3 is also (DrWatson & Pkg) project based and uses Pluto notebooks, I have converted the book `listings` in the first 5 chapters to Pluto Notebooks in a new repository in StatisticalRethinkingJulia, i.e. [StatisticsWithJuliaPlutoNotebooks](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticsWithJuliaPlutoNotebooks.jl). 

After chapter 4, `Statistics with Julia` follows the frequentionist approach while `Statistical Rethinking` opts for the Bayesian approach. Most of the material in chapters 5 and 6 of `Statistics with Julia` is therefore also covered using a more Bayesian perspective in the early chapters of the notebook projects [StatisticalRethinkingStan](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl) and [StatisticalRethinkingTuring](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl). 

## Purpose of this package

The StatisticalRethinking.jl v3 `package` contains functions comparable to the functions in the R package "rethinking" associated with the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) by Richard McElreath. These functions are used in the Pluto notebooks in `projects`.

To work through the StatisticalRethinking book using Julia and Stan, download `project` [StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl) and open one of the chapter Pluto notebooks.

To work through the StatisticalRethinking book using Julia and Turing, download `project` [StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl) and open a Pluto notebook.

Time permitting I would love to see a StatisticalRethinkingDhmc.jl, which could be a combination of Soss.jl and DynamicHMC.jl, and a StatisticalRethinkingMamba.jl!

If interested in either of the last 2 projects, please contact me!

## Versions

### Version 3.0.0 (in preparation, Oct 2020)

StatisticalRethinking.jl v3 is independent of the underlying mcmc package. All scripts previously in StatisticalRethinking.jl v2 holding the snippets have been replaced by Pluto notebooks in the above mentioned mcmc specific `project` repositories.

Initially StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl will lag StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl somewhat but later this year both will cover the same chapters.

It is the intention to develop *tests* for StatisticalRethinking.jl v3 that work across the different mcmc implementations. This will limit dependencies to the `test/Project.toml`.

## Installation

To install the package (from the REPL):

```
] add StatisticalRethinking
```

but in most cases this package will be a dependency of another package or project, e.g. StatisticalRethinkingStan.jl or StatisticalRethinkingTuring.jl.

## Acknowledgements

Of course, without the excellent textbook by Richard McElreath, this package would not have been possible. The author has also been supportive of this work and gave permission to use the datasets.
